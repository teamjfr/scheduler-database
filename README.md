For recovering password, you have to provide the email id, date of birth,phone number and the answer you provided while signing up.If they match with the database you will get the password.

After signing in, you will see calendar of the current month.Red color show the current date.You can go to the previous month and next month by clicking on the left and right arrow respectively.
For accessing the system, you have to click on any date.Every date works as button.

After selecting a date, you will be able to see the upcoming 7 days task and meeting list.Now there are 5 options.Task,Meeting, Schedule Work, Note and Create Group.

****\*\*\***** For Assigned Task ****\*\*****

If you click on the task option then then we will be able to see the task list for that selected date.That shows the task name,due date and due time.If you bring your cursor on the task name, you
will see the description and starting time.If you click on the task name you will get a message to mark the task as done.If you mark as done you will not be able to see the task anymore.Otherwise
task will be shown.

****\*\*\***** For Assigning Task ****\*\*****
There is plus sign for assigning task.If you click ,you will get a form for assigning.Providing task name and description,you will get option for days.You can assign a task for a signle day or for
multple days.If you assign for single day,you need to provide the starting date,time and finishing time.But for multiple days,you need to select the finishing date as well.
After that our system will ask you for whom you want to assign task.You can assign task for own self ,for already created groups
or for others.After that you need to click on the save button.If all the information is correct then you will get a successfull
message.Otherwise an error message.and will directly go to the main option.

Now if you click on the meeting, you will see the meeting list with the link,starting and finishing time for that selected date.If you take your mouse on the meeting name you will be able
to see the description.If you click on the meeting name ,will get a option to mark the meeting as done.If you mark it as done then the meeting will not be shown anymore.There is another option.
If you click on the meeting link,meeting will be started automatically.

There is also a plus sign like the task to assign meeting.Almost all features are same except one.For Multiple days,you will get a option for choosing a day of
week.You need to select a day of a week on which the meeting will be held.Then you have to provide a starting date and a finishing date.Our system will
assign meeting for that day of a week for the provided range of the dates and will show either a success or an error message.

Our third option is schedule work.This function basically helps to find a time slot for a day to complete your work.You have to provide the task name and description .Then you will provide
the starting date and time and finsihing date and time as well.You need to also provide a time that is required to finish the work.Now if you click on the save button,our system will check the
free slots for those days.If total free time is greater than required time,you will get a frame where the free time for a day will be shown.You have to select time.Then by pressing ok you will get a message and task will be saved
in the database.Otherwise will show a short of time message.

Note option is for keeping diary.If you click,you will be able to see what we have wrote for that date.We can select text file from the desktop and save it in the database.

This is our last option.For assigning task or meeting for a huge number of people again and again,is time consuming and boring.Thats why we provide this option.Here you will see the already created group
list.From the group user can add new email id or delete one email id at a time.There is also a plus sign for creating new group.You need to give a group name and ids and add them.By clicking done button
you will go to the main menu.

There is an option to go back to the calendar.
